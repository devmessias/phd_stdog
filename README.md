# stDoG - Structure and Dynamics on Graphs (Beta)

stDoG is a Tensorflow Python module for efficiently simulating phase oscillators (the Kuramoto model) on large heterogeneous networks. It provides an implementation for integrating differential equations using TensorFlow, making simulations suitable to be performed on GPUs.

## Install

To install stDoG, download the package and type at the command line: 

```
python install setup.py
```

## Example



```python

from tkuramoto.utils import ig2sparse #Function to convert igraph format to sparse matrix
from tkuramoto.gpu.heuns import Heuns
...
```
