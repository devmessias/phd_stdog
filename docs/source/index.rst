Strucutre and Dyanmics on Graphs
----------------------------------------
.. image:: imgs/stdog.png

The main goal of stDoG is provide a package which can be used to study
dynamics and structural properties (like spectra) on/off graphs with a huge
ammout of vertices. The modules of stDoG is being built using a combination
of code written in *Tensorflow* + *CUDA* and *C++*


The package is available as as pypi repository

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install stdog

The source code is available at <http://github.com/stdogpkg>`.
